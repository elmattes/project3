Use only the following standard Lisp functions, macros, operators, and constants in your definitions, along with any previously completed functions in this project:

    - T
    - NIL
    - IF
    - WHEN
    - COND
    - NOT       -> returns t if x is nil, or returns nil
    - AND       -> returns nil if any of the inputs are nil, or value of last
    - OR        -> returns first non-nil value found, or value of last
    - EQUAL     -> T iff identical type and object? (NOTE: equal not eq)
    - CONS      -> add element to front of list. ex: (cons 1 '(2 3 4)) returns (1 2 3 4)
    - LIST      -> constructs a list from given args
    - CAR       -> grab first element in list, throws error if empty or not list
    - CDR       -> grab last elemtn in list, throws error if empty or not list
    - FIRST     -> access first element of list/vector/...sequence? 
    - SECOND
    - THIRD
    - LENGTH    -> computes length of vector/string/list
    - DEFUN
    - LABELS    -> allow recursion? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381491/use-of-labels-in-common-lisp
    - LET 
    - LET*      -> use variables that depend on options
    - FUNCALL   -> applies function to arguments ?
    - QUOTE     -> pass arguments to function as exact: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134887/when-to-use-or-quote-in-lisp
    - any arithmetic operator or relation (+, -, *, /, <, <=, >, >=, =)
    - any numerical constant
